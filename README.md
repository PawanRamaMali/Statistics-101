### Descriptive versus inferential statistics

Descriptive statistics is the branch of statistics aiming at describing and summarizing a set of data in the best possible manner, that is, by reducing it down to a few meaningful key measures and visualizationsâ€”with as little loss of information as possible. In other words, the branch of descriptive statistics helps to have a better understanding and a clear picture about a set of observations thanks to summary statistics and graphics. With descriptive statistics, there is no uncertainty because we describe only the group of observations that we decided to work on and no attempt is made to generalize the observed characteristics to another or to a larger group of observations.

Inferential statistics, one the other hand, is the branch of statistics that uses a random sample of data taken from a population to make inferences, i.e., to draw conclusions about the population of interest. In other words, information from the sample is used to make generalizations about the parameter of interest in the population.

The two most important tools used in the domain of inferential statistics are:

* hypothesis test , and
* confidence interval
