### Descriptive versus inferential statistics

Descriptive statistics is the branch of statistics aiming at describing and summarizing a set of data in the best possible manner, that is, by reducing it down to a few meaningful key measures and visualizations—with as little loss of information as possible. In other words, the branch of descriptive statistics helps to have a better understanding and a clear picture about a set of observations thanks to summary statistics and graphics. With descriptive statistics, there is no uncertainty because we describe only the group of observations that we decided to work on and no attempt is made to generalize the observed characteristics to another or to a larger group of observations.

Inferential statistics, one the other hand, is the branch of statistics that uses a random sample of data taken from a population to make inferences, i.e., to draw conclusions about the population of interest. In other words, information from the sample is used to make generalizations about the parameter of interest in the population.

The two most important tools used in the domain of inferential statistics are:

* hypothesis test , and
* confidence interval 

### Motivation and Reason

I have realized that many students (especially in introductory statistic classes) struggle to perform hypothesis tests and interpret the results. It seems to me that these students often encounter difficulties mainly because hypothesis testing is rather unclear and abstract to them. One of the reason it looks abstract to them is because they do not understand the final goal of hypothesis testing—the “why” behind this tool. They often do inferential statistics without understanding the reasoning behind it, as if they were following a cooking recipe which does not require any thinking. However, as soon as they understand the principle underlying hypothesis testing, it is much easier for them to apply the concepts.

For this reason, I though it would be useful to write an article on the goal of hypothesis tests (the “why?”), in which context they should be used (the “when?”), how they work (the “how?”) and how to interpret the results (the “so what?”). Like anything else in statistics, it becomes much easier to apply a concept in practice when we understand what we are testing or what we are trying to demonstrate beforehand.

In this article, I present—as comprehensibly as possible—the different steps required to perform and conclude a hypothesis test by hand. These steps are illustrated with a basic example. This will build the theoretical foundations of hypothesis testing, which will in turn be of great help for the understanding of most statistical tests.

Hypothesis tests come in many forms and can be used for many parameters or research questions. The steps I present in this article are not applicable to all hypothesis test, unfortunately. They are however, appropriate for at least the most common hypothesis tests—the tests on:

* One mean: μ
* Two means:
* independent samples: μ1 and μ2
* paired samples: μD
* One proportion: p
* Two proportions: p1 and p2
* One variance: σ2
* Two variances: σ21 and σ22

The good news is that the principles behind these 6 statistical tests (and many more) are exactly the same. So if you understand the intuition and the process for one of them, all others pretty much follow.
